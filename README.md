# BigDL Documentation

All official released docs are available in [BigDl Docs](https://intel-analytics.github.io/bigdl-doc/)

The source for bigDL documentation is in this directory under `sources/`. 
Our documentation uses extended Markdown, as implemented by [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org).

## Building the documentation in local server:

- install MkDocs: `pip install mkdocs`
- `cd` to the `source/'folder and run:
    - `mkdocs serve`    # Starts a local webserver:  [localhost:8000](localhost:8000)
    - `mkdocs build`    # Builds a static site in "site" directory
